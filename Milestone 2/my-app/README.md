# How to install

- go to the my-app directory in Milestone 2
- install node.js here if you dont already have it: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
- run the following commands:
    - 'npm install'
    - 'npm run build'
    - 'npm start'
- open localhost 3000

Troubleshooting: 
- if "npm start" doesn't work, make sure to go to src/frontend and run it there!
