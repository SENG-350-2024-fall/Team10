System Description


Describe the system in your own words (0.5-1 page)
The system aims to target the currently very long ED wait times by allowing patients to forsee their waiting time, register online, and have clinicians assess what the patients next steps should be. The patient can either wait from the comfort of their own home or be redirected to a general practitioner or a pharmacy. This kind of system would be practical in the medical field worldwide, especially ones with a higher demand for doctors. Additionally, there are many cases of people misusing Emergency Rooms for issues that do not require emergency care. This system will filter out false emergencies and reduce wait times in general.

There are two main users of the system: the patients and the clinicians. Each one is required to create an account and each actor is granted different permissions within the system. The patient will only have access to wait times, ED queue registration, their own account and medical records, and to communication with medical staff. The medical staff will have access to all patient files, all wait times, patients’ submitted assessment questionnaires, and communication with all clinics and all patients. The medical staff will be able to suggest a course of action for the patient to take based on their assessment of their questionnaire and figure out whether waiting for emergency services is appropriate in the patient’s case.

Bullet Point: Interactive virtual software that enables patients to get the help they need faster than everyone waiting in the ED Patients can view the stat Patient logs in/registers Dynamic questionnaire that adapts to the patient's previous answers. Recommends next steps: Go to GP Over the counter medication Use hotline Visit ED immediately Visit ED when notified by system
