# Milestone 3

# Architecture Tactics - Availability

1. self test (script)
   - database connection test
3. exception handling
   - show user friendly error messages on incorrect/invalid inputs to the system
5. graceful degradation
   - if map library breaks, display error message/page
6. retry
   - automatically retry failed database interactions after a short waiting period
8. removal from service
   - remove triage feature when service unavailable
  

for each:
  - how it's manifested in the design
  - how you plan to test whether your quality attribute objective will be met.
